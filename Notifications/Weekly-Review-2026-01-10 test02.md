📅 **Week in Review**


**📊 Quick Stats:**
- Items captured: 0
- Breakdown: 0 people, 0 projects, 0 ideas, 0 admin

**🎯 What Moved Forward:**
Nothing moved forward this week. No new captures recorded.

**🔴 Open Loops (needs attention):**
1. 2026 Front Office Build-Out project stalled at single bullet point: hiring undefined
2. Zero captures indicate system breakdown or complete passivity

**💡 Patterns I Notice:**
System dormant. Front-office hiring criteria undefined suggests either analysis paralysis or strategic uncertainty. Zero captures unusual and warrants investigation.

**📌 Suggested Focus for Next Week:**
1. Determine actual business requirements for front-office team
2. Define specific roles and autonomy scope
3. Restart capture mechanism - current system not operational

**🔧 Items Needing Manual Classification:**
None - all items classified successfully
