📅 **Week in Review**

**📊 Quick Stats:**
- Items captured: 4
- Breakdown: 0 people, 1 project, 2 ideas, 1 undefined

**🎯 What Moved Forward:**
- Front-office build-out project activated with clear next step
- Two AI-related ideas captured indicating strategic thinking about 2026

**🔴 Open Loops (needs attention):**
1. Both AI ideas lack elaboration - no context, details, or connection to current work
2. One undefined/blank capture creating processing drag

**💡 Patterns I Notice:**
Low capture volume suggests either low input or poor capture discipline. Heavy focus on 2026 planning but sparse detail indicates possible strategic avoidance - thinking about future instead of executing present.

**📌 Suggested Focus for Next Week:**
1. Expand on AI ideas: write 3 sentences on each about why they matter now
2. Finalize hiring criteria for front-office roles (next action already defined)
3. Fix capture system - one blank entry indicates capture friction

**🔧 Items Needing Review:**
1 AI stride idea
1 AI trajectory idea
1 undefined item
