  Today is the first day back after a very long 2 week break. I'm kind of looking forward to it. I think 2026 will be an interesting year. Ai will find its stride and progress will accelerate even faster. I think this round of hiring could be privet toward a very strong front office. Maybe even to the point of being relatively hands off with backups.
