  Today is the first day back after a very long 2-week break. I'm kind of looking forward to it. I think 2026 will be an interesting year. AI will find its stride and progress will accelerate even faster. This round of hiring could be directed toward a very strong front office—maybe even to the point of being relatively hands-off with backups. Rosenberg keeps calling for doom, but he put money into energy companies. That only makes sense if the economy is going up. I need to focus my geopolitical interest in Latin America. Following George Friedman will make that happen naturally.
