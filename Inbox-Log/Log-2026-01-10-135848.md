  Today is the first day back after a very long 2-week break. I'm kind of looking forward to it. I think 2026 will be an interesting year. AI will find its stride and progress will accelerate even faster. This round of hiring could be directed toward a very strong front office—maybe even to the point of being relatively hands-off with backups.
