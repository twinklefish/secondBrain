## Quick Capture

**Tip:** Separate thoughts with `---` or use `@category: text` to force classification

Examples:
- `@people: Sarah mentioned she's looking for a new job`
- `@projects: Build onboarding flow, need to gather requirements`
- `@admin: Renew car registration by Jan 15th`

AI will find its stride and progress will accelerate even faster. I think this round of hiring could be private toward a very strong front office. Maybe even to the point of being relatively hands-off with backups.
