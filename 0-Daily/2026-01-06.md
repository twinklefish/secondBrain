## Quick Capture

**Tip:** Separate thoughts with `---` or use `@category: text` to force classification

Examples:
- `@people: Sarah mentioned she's looking for a new job`
- `@projects: Build onboarding flow, need to gather requirements`
- `@admin: Renew car registration by Jan 15th`

## Journal

Today is the first day back after a very long 2 week break. I'm kind of looking forward to it. I think 2026 will be an interesting year. Ai will find its stride and progress will accelerate even faster. This round of hiring could be directed toward a very strong front office. Maybe even to the point of being relatively hands off with backups. Rosenberg keeps calling for doom, but he put a money into energy companies. That only makes sense if the economy is going up. I need to focus my geopolitical interest in Latin America. Following George Friedman will make that happen naturally.
